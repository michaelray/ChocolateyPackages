    <summary>Purple Facebook implements the Facebook Messenger protocol into pidgin, finch, and libpurple.</summary>
    <description>Purple Facebook implements the Facebook Messenger protocol into pidgin, finch, and libpurple. While the primary implementation is for purple3, this plugin is back-ported for purple2.
    
      The purple-facebook plugin is a replacement for the builtin Facebook XMPP plugin. Facebook is in the process of shutting down their XMPP service, which will inevitably break existing support.

      As part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015, jgeboski worked on a plugin for libpurple to support the newer Facebook Messenger protocol. The plugin is implemented for the development version of libpurple, purple3, which has yet to be released. The purple-facebook project simply back-ports the purple3 plugin to purple2, which is the released version of libpurple.

      As of October 18, 2015, jgeboski's GSoC work was merged into the mainline Pidgin project. It will appear in the next major release of Pidgin.

      **Notes from the Chocolatey package owner(s):
      
        -The purple-facebook project adds support for the Facebook Messenger protocol in pidgin, finch, and libpurple, but this Chocolatey package is for adding Facebook Messenger support for pidgin, specifically.
        
        -The current (in development) releases of purple-facebook are not semantically versioned ( http://semver.org/ ) and are not otherwise sequentially ordered (on GitHub), so this Chocolatey package will be versioned as 0.0.0.{BUILD_NUMBER}{2_DIGIT_SUFFIX} (replacing {BUILD_NUMBER} with the build number (provided from the automated builds) in 4-digit format and replacing {2_DIGIT_SUFFIX} with the a 2 digit value that will be incremented for each Chocolatey package update for the same BUILD_NUMBER).  For example, the first version of this Chocolatey package is 0.0.0.001400 since this is automated build #14 ("0014") and this is the first version of the Chocolatey package for that build number ("00").
